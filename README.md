# Max7219_LightPen
light pen system for eventually drawing on max7219 led arrays.

This code is not 'arduino' but written raw for the atmega328 itself. 
I use gcc and avrdude via the makefile, which can utilize the arduino bootloader.
Arduino-ize it if you like, I'd be happy to do a pull.

schematics and build photos are in the folder.

This is just a quick post, I can add more detail!
